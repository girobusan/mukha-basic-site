title: Tags

Tags are generated automatically, just list them in frontmatter, Mukha will do the rest.
Thanks to the unidecode library, you can use tags in any language (almost).

```
---
title: My tagged page
tags: tags, неожиданность, strange thoughts, मुख
---
...text...
```

You can also create _physical_ pages for your favourite tags, like [this one](/+name:tag_correctly).
